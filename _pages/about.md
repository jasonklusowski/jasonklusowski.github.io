Biography
======

I am an assistant professor in the [Department of Operations Research & Financial Engineering](https://orfe.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University. Previously, I was an assistant professor in the [Department of Statistics](http://statistics.rutgers.edu/) at Rutgers University, New Brunswick. I received my PhD in [Statistics and Data Science](https://statistics.yale.edu/) from Yale University in 2018, where I was fortunate to have been mentored by [Andrew Barron](http://www.stat.yale.edu/~arb4/). From 2017 to 2018, I was a visiting graduate student in the statistics department at Wharton.

My research is partially supported by [NSF DMS-1915932](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1915932) (PI) and [TRIPODS DATA-INSPIRE Institute CCF-1934924](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1934924) (Senior Personnel). Thank you, NSF!

I am a participating faculty at the [Center for Statistics and Machine Learning (CSML)](https://csml.princeton.edu/) at Princeton and senior personnel on [TRIPODS DATA-INSPIRE Institute](http://robotics.cs.rutgers.edu/data-inspire/) at Rutgers.
<!-- which is a new, trans-disciplinary institute on data science for intelligent systems and people interaction. -->

My [spouse](https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/jwkk/) is a behavioral marketing PhD student at Wharton. I am (slowly) learning Korean from her.

Research Interests
======

I am broadly interested in statistical learning theory, though most of my recent work has focused on the study and design of prediction algorithms for regression and classification.

* decision tree learning (e.g., random forests, CART)
* neural networks (approximation and statistical properties)
