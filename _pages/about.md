CV
======

My curriculum vitae is available [here](https://jasonklusowski.github.io/files/Klusowski_cv.pdf).

Biography
======

I received my PhD in Statistics and Data Science from Yale University in 2018, where I was fortunate to have been mentored by [Andrew Barron](http://www.stat.yale.edu/~arb4/). Since Fall 2018, I have been an [Assistant Professor](https://statistics.rutgers.edu/people-pages/faculty/people/130-faculty/396-jason-m-klusowski) in the [Department of Statistics](http://statistics.rutgers.edu/) at Rutgers University - New Brunswick.

My research is partially supported by [NSF DMS-1915932](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1915932) (PI) and [NSF HDR TRIPODS-1934924](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1934924) (Senior Personnel). Thank you, NSF!

I am a senior personnel on TRIPODS Institute ‘[DATA-INSPIRE](http://robotics.cs.rutgers.edu/data-inspire/)’ at Rutgers, which is a new, trans-disciplinary institute on data science for intelligent systems and people interaction.

My [wife](https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/jwkk/) is a behavioral marketing PhD student at Wharton.

Research Interests
======

I am broadly interested in statistical learning theory, though most of my recent work has focused on the study and design of prediction algorithms for regression and classification.

* tree-structured learning (e.g., random forests)
* neural networks (approximation and statistical theory)
* latent variable models (e.g., mixture models)

Reading Group
======

The [Rutgers Statistical Machine Learning Reading Group](http://nineisprime.github.io/sml_reading/) runs each Tuesday 2:00-3:00pm in Hill 260. All are welcome to attend!
