Biography
======

Since Fall 2018, I have been an [Assistant Professor](https://statistics.rutgers.edu/people-pages/faculty/people/130-faculty/396-jason-m-klusowski) in the [Department of Statistics](http://statistics.rutgers.edu/) at Rutgers University — New Brunswick. I received my PhD in Statistics and Data Science from Yale University in 2018, where I was fortunate to have been mentored by [Andrew Barron](http://www.stat.yale.edu/~arb4/). From 2017 to 2018, I was a visiting graduate student in the statistics department at Wharton. 

My research is partially supported by [NSF DMS-1915932](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1915932) (PI) and [NSF HDR TRIPODS-1934924](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1934924) (Senior Personnel). Thank you, NSF!

I am a senior personnel on TRIPODS Institute ‘[DATA-INSPIRE](http://robotics.cs.rutgers.edu/data-inspire/)’ at Rutgers, which is a new, trans-disciplinary institute on data science for intelligent systems and people interaction.

My [wife](https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/jwkk/) is a behavioral marketing PhD student at Wharton.
